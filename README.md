# Free Synthetic Data Collections for students beginning to learn ML
A collection of free data items that can be used by students beginning to learn ML (machine learning) .

CSV files have been uploaded. Each CSV file has some independent features/vectors/columns and many dependent features/labels. You can use the CSV files to train your ML model/(X)NN models. Each CSV file has a corresponding .ipynb file, which is aimed at showing how to use the CSV file. You will be surprised how easy it is to generate a model for some of the features and how hard it is to generate a model for others. Can you figure out the reason why it did not work for some cases? Little bit of thinking :-)

### Please note that you might need to adjust settings in the attached ipynb files (if you want to use them), depending upon how much memory your computer has.

Following files have been uploaded.
