# Free Synthetic Data Collections for students beginning to learn ML
A collection of free data items that can be used by students beginning to learn ML (machine learning) .

CSV files have been uploaded. Each CSV file has some independent features/vectors/columns and many dependent features/labels. You can use the CSV files to train your ML model/(X)NN models. Each CSV file has a corresponding .ipynb file, which is aimed at showing how to use the CSV file. You will be surprised how easy it is to generate a model for some of the features and how hard it is to generate a model for others.
